# UoM_MapReduce-vs-Spark

We utilized Hadoop to store and process an enormous amount of data. For storage, we used HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), and for processing, we used MapReduce. We analyzed the data using Hive, which uses HiveQL statements that run on the MapReduce framework. Additionally, we used Spark to analyze the data by using Spark-SQL, which runs on the Spark framework. We compared the results between MapReduce and Apache Spark, using the Airline delay dataset collected from Kaggle.
